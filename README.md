# URL to RTMP - Web Page to Live Stream

Stream any web page to YouTube Live, Twitch, or any other RTMP-compatible service. This project uses Playwright to capture a target web page in a headless browser and streams it 24/7 using FFmpeg. It's designed for reliable, long-running cloud deployment in a Docker container.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üî¥ Live Stream Any Web Page:** Capture and stream dynamic web content.
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Ready:** Optimized for 24/7 deployment on services like Railway, Render, Heroku, AWS, and GCP.
- **üê≥ Dockerized:** Includes a production-ready `Dockerfile` with Playwright and FFmpeg pre-installed.
- **üöÄ Remote Control API:** Start, stop, and check the stream status via a simple REST API.
- **üîê Secure Access:** Protect API endpoints with an optional access keyword.
- **üîß Highly Configurable:** Adjust resolution, FPS, and bitrate using environment variables.
- **üîá Silent Audio Track:** Includes a synthetic silent audio track, a requirement for many streaming platforms like YouTube Live.
- **üîÑ Auto-Restart:** (If configured) Can automatically restart the stream on container startup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Koa Web Server:** A lightweight server starts and exposes API endpoints.
2.  **Playwright Browser:** When the `/start` endpoint is called, Playwright launches a headless Chromium browser.
3.  **Page Navigation:** It navigates to the `TARGET_URL` you provide.
4.  **Screenshot Loop:** The application takes screenshots of the page at the configured `STREAM_FPS`.
5.  **FFmpeg Pipe:** Each screenshot is piped directly to an FFmpeg process.
6.  **RTMP Streaming:** FFmpeg encodes the screenshots into a video stream (H.264) with a silent audio track (AAC) and sends it to your specified RTMP server.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Docker and Docker Compose
-   A YouTube, Twitch, or other account with RTMP stream details.

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/url-to-rtmp.git
    cd url-to-rtmp
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Copy the `env.example` to a new file named `.env`.
    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Configure your stream:**
    Edit the `.env` file with your details:
    -   `TARGET_URL`: The full URL of the web page you want to stream.
    -   `YOUTUBE_RTMP_URL`: The RTMP ingest URL from your streaming provider.
    -   `YOUTUBE_STREAM_KEY`: Your unique stream key.
    -   `ACCESS_KEYWORD`: A secret password to protect the API endpoints.

4.  **Build and run with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The service will be running and available at `http://localhost:3000`.

5.  **Start the stream:**
    Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send a POST request to the `/start` endpoint.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/start \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"keyword": "your-secret-keyword"}'
    ```

## üîß Configuration

All configuration is managed through environment variables, making it easy to deploy. See `env.example` for a full list of available options and detailed comments.

| Variable             | Description                                           | Default      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `TARGET_URL`         | **Required.** The web page to stream.                 | -            |
| `YOUTUBE_RTMP_URL`   | **Required.** The RTMP ingest URL.                    | -            |

| `HEADLESS`           | Run browser in headless mode.                         | `true`       |
| `AUTO_START`         | Automatically start streaming on container launch.    | `false`      |

## API Endpoints

-   **`POST /start`**: Starts the web capture and RTMP stream.
-   **`POST /stop`**: Stops the stream and closes the browser.
-   **`GET /status`**: Gets the current status of the streamer.
-   **`GET /`**: A simple health check endpoint.

**Request Body for protected endpoints (`/start`, `/stop`):**
```json
{
  "keyword": "your-secret-keyword"
}
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is designed for flexible deployment. You can run it on modern Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers or on your own Virtual Machine (VM) for more control and potentially lower cost for 24/7 operation.

### Option 1: Deploy to a Cloud Platform (PaaS)

For the easiest, most managed deployment experience, we recommend using a cloud platform that directly supports Docker containers. This approach minimizes infrastructure management.

‚û°Ô∏è **See our detailed [Cloud Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md) for instructions on:**
-   **Railway**
-   **Render**
-   **Heroku**
-   **Google Cloud Run, AWS App Runner**, and more.

### Option 2: Deploy to a Personal Server or VM (IaaS)

For 24/7 streaming, running the application on a dedicated Virtual Machine can be significantly more cost-effective. Below are the detailed steps for deploying to a **Google Compute Engine (GCE) VM**. This guide can be adapted for any Linux-based VM (e.g., from AWS, DigitalOcean, or a home server).

#### Deploying to Google Compute Engine (GCE)

**Estimated Cost:** A 24/7 `e2-medium` instance (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) costs approximately **$25-30/month**.

**Architecture:** We will create a GCE instance that runs a startup script to install Docker and clone this repository. A `systemd` service will be configured to automatically run the streamer via Docker Compose and ensure it restarts on boot or if it fails.

##### Step 1: Create a Startup Script

This script will run once when the VM is first created to set up the environment. Create a file named `gce-startup-script.sh` on your local machine.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# URL-to-RTMP GCE Startup Script

# 1. Update system and install dependencies
apt-get update
apt-get install -y git docker.io docker-compose

# 2. Clone the application repository
# IMPORTANT: Replace with your repository URL
git clone https://github.com/liberator-app/url-to-RTMP.git /opt/url-to-rtmp

# 3. Create the systemd service file to manage the application
cat <<EOF > /etc/systemd/system/url-to-rtmp.service
[Unit]
Description=URL to RTMP Docker Compose Service
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
WorkingDirectory=/opt/url-to-rtmp
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker-compose up
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker-compose down

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

# 4. Enable the service so it starts on boot
systemctl enable url-to-rtmp.service

# Note: The service will not successfully start until the user creates the .env file.
```

##### Step 2: Create and Configure the GCE VM

Run the following `gcloud` command from your local terminal to create the VM instance.

```bash
gcloud compute instances create url-to-rtmp-vm \
    --project=YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID \
    --zone=us-central1-a \
    --machine-type=e2-medium \
    --image-family=debian-11 \
    --image-project=debian-cloud \
    --boot-disk-size=20GB \
    --tags=http-server \
    --metadata-from-file=startup-script=./gce-startup-script.sh
```
-   Replace `YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID` with your project ID.
-   This command creates a VM, attaches our startup script, and tags it for HTTP traffic.

##### Step 3: Set Up Firewall Rule

Allow external traffic to reach the API server on port `3000`.
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-streamer-api \
    --allow tcp:3000 \
    --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 \
    --target-tags=http-server
```

##### Step 4: Configure and Start the Streamer

1.  **SSH into your new VM:**
    ```bash
    gcloud compute ssh url-to-rtmp-vm --zone=us-central1-a
    ```

2.  **Create your environment file:**
    The repository was cloned to `/opt/url-to-rtmp`. Navigate there and create your `.env` file.
    ```bash
    cd /opt/url-to-rtmp
    sudo cp env.example .env
    sudo nano .env
    ```
    Fill in your `TARGET_URL`, `YOUTUBE_RTMP_URL`, `YOUTUBE_STREAM_KEY`, and `ACCESS_KEYWORD`. Save the file (`Ctrl+X`, `Y`, `Enter`).

3.  **Start the service:**
    The `systemd` service is already enabled but may have failed because the `.env` file was missing. Now you can start it manually.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start url-to-rtmp
    ```

##### Step 5: Manage and Monitor the Service

-   **Check Status:** See if the service is running correctly.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status url-to-rtmp
    ```
-   **View Logs:** Watch the real-time output of your Docker container.
    ```bash
    sudo journalctl -fu url-to-rtmp.service
    ```
-   **Restarting:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart url-to-rtmp
    ```

Your service is now deployed and will run 24/7, automatically restarting if the VM reboots or the process crashes.

## Troubleshooting

-   **"Bitrate is lower than recommended" warning:** Increase the `STREAM_BITRATE` to match your streaming provider's recommendation (e.g., `8000k` for YouTube 1080p).
-   **High CPU Usage:** The streaming process is CPU-intensive. If you experience performance issues, try lowering the `STREAM_WIDTH`/`STREAM_HEIGHT` to `1280`/`720` or reducing the `STREAM_FPS` to `24`.
-   **FFmpeg errors:** Ensure your `YOUTUBE_RTMP_URL` and `YOUTUBE_STREAM_KEY` are correct. The logs will print FFmpeg's output for debugging.
